# Set Hadoop-specific environment variables here.

##
## THIS FILE ACTS AS THE MASTER FILE FOR ALL HADOOP PROJECTS.
## SETTINGS HERE WILL BE READ BY ALL HADOOP COMMANDS.  THEREFORE,
## ONE CAN USE THIS FILE TO SET YARN, HDFS, AND MAPREDUCE
## CONFIGURATION OPTIONS INSTEAD OF xxx-env.sh.
##
## Precedence rules:
##
## {yarn-env.sh|hdfs-env.sh} > hadoop-env.sh > hard-coded defaults
##
## {YARN_xyz|HDFS_xyz} > HADOOP_xyz > hard-coded defaults
##

###
# Generic settings for HADOOP
###

# Technically, the only required environment variable is JAVA_HOME.
# All others are optional.  However, the defaults are probably not
# preferred.  Many sites configure these options outside of Hadoop,
# such as in /etc/profile.d

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-arm64/

# Location of Hadoop.  By default, Hadoop will attempt to determine
# this location based upon its execution path.
export HADOOP_HOME=/opt/hadoop-3.1.1

# Location of Hadoop's configuration information.  i.e., where this
# file is living. If this is not defined, Hadoop will attempt to
# locate it based upon its execution path.

export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=${HADOOP_HOME}/etc/hadoop

# Where (primarily) daemon log files are stored.
# ${HADOOP_HOME}/logs by default.
# Java property: hadoop.log.dir
export HADOOP_LOG_DIR=${HADOOP_HOME}/logs
